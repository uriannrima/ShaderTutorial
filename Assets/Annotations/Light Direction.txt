Light Direction in Unity:

Getting the light is easy:

	_WorldSpaceLightPos0

That is a special float4 that handles any light in Unity:
	- If it is a point light, _WorldSpaceLightPos0.xyz is the location
	- If it is a direction light, _WorldSpaceLightPos0.xyz is the rotation
	- _WorldSpaceLightPos0.w is:
		- 1 for direction light.
		- 0 for point light.
