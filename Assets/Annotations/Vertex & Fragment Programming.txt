Vertex Program:
Deals with everything once per vertex, per frame, use VertexInput as base and write to VertexOutput.
The only required thing in this function, is the VertexPosition, so Unity knows where to render the object.
Everything else, is extra to fancy effects.

Fragment Program:
Deals with everything once per pixel per frame, and also refered as pixel shader.
Use VertexOutput as base of calculations and returning a Color for that pixel.
Overload commonly happens at this function if overloaded.
