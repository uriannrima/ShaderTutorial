Normal Direction

To get the normal direction:
 - We use the semantic NORMAL, and asign it to a variable
 - Multiply it by _World2Object float4x4 matrix to get the normal in the object space.
	- This calculation, we'll be doing it in the vertex program knows as Vertex lighning.
	- It can be done on the fragment programming too, known as Pixel lightning.
