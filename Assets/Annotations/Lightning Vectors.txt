Lightning Vectors:

Light Direction (L) - Direction which the lights is coming from.
View Direction (V) - Direction which the viewer is.
Normal Direction (N) - Direction away from the surface (where light hit)
Reflected direction (R) - 90º degrees from the light, based on the normal direction
Halfway Vector (H) - Half way vector from the View and Light direction.

Using dot product we can calculate the distance between those vectors.
and create variance in lightning.

Dot product is very common in light.
Returns a value from -1 to 1 as much the first vector gets closer to the second.
Vector ABC, DEF (A and D are X, B and E are Y, C and F are Z)
	
	DOT(ABC,DEF) = A*D+B*E+C*F 
	So, its a scalar, from -1 to 1.

Thinks like that
			 0
		-0.5	0.5
	-1				+1 N -> <-L
		-0.5	0.5	
			  0
If we calculate the DOT from Normal (N) and Light (L), and it gives an 1
It means that the normal reflect ALL light on it.

			 0
		-0.5	0.5
<-N	-1				+1 <- L
		-0.5	0.5	
			  0
In this case, the Normal (N) and Light (L) gives an 0 Dot product
So it won't reflect any light.

Half way though each one, will give partial lightning (0.5)
And partial no lightning (-0.5), wich for us, is unrealistic so we consider 0.
