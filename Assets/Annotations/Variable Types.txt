Float / Half / Fixed:

Float:
	- Floating point number
	- Most precise and "perfect"
	- But the most expensive to render

Half:
	- Half the precision from float
		- 3.3 decimal precision
		- Plus/Minus 60.000 range
	- Not that perfect, but good enough
	Much more efficient

Fixed:
	- Really small precision
		- 2^8 = 256 values
		- It means, that goes from 0 to 255 (INT)
		- Or from -2 and +2 (FLOAT)
		- Or from -128 to +128 (INT)
	- Most optimized
	- Perfect for Color and Dot products
	- Almost from -1 to 1, so can be used for some calculations
